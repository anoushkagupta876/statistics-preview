### What I learned

I explored the mix-blend-mode for an image in CSS and how surprisinlgy how versatile and creative one can be with it.

```css
.image{
background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 30%);
border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}

.image img{
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  display: block;
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  width: 100%;
  opacity: 0.7;
  mix-blend-mode: overlay;
}
```

### Continued development

I would definitely like to explore mix-blend-mode further. Though I made this responsive without Bootstrap and was pretty quick, but I would definitely like to try a Bootstrap version. 

### Useful resources
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an website  which I refer back and forth for syntax and properties. I'd recommend it to everyone - beginners and professionals.
